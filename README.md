## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type,
weight, sets, reps and duration of the exercise. If the exercise is a cardeo exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
